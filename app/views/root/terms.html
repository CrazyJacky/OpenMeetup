    <p><strong>THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE TERMS ON WHICH MEETUPEDIA OFFERS YOU ACCESS TO OUR WEBSITES, PLATFORM AND SERVICES:</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to Meetupedia. We provide our websites (including meetupedia.com and meetupedia.org) platforms, tools, and services (together, the "Platform") to you subject to the terms of service set forth in this Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement"). A statement of our privacy policy may be found at http://www.meetupedia.com/privacy/.</p>

    <p>We may update the Agreement at any time. When we do, we will revise the "Revision date" at the top of this Agreement, and you may view the most recent version at http://www.meetupedia.com/terms. It is your responsibility to review the most recent version of the Agreement frequently and remain informed about any changes to it. By continuing to use the Platform, you consent to any updates to this Agreement. This version of the Agreement supersedes all earlier versions, and comprises the entire agreement between you and Meetupedia regarding the Platform. By accessing or using the Platform, you accept this Agreement and any modifications that we may make to this Agreement from time to time. If you do not agree to any provision of this Agreement, you should not use the Platform.</p>

    <h2>1. Platform</h2>

    <p>Our Platform provides our users with a variety of resources to facilitate organizing of groups, (a "meetup" or "meetup group" or "group" or "Meetupedia group"), events (a "Meetupedia event" or "event") and browsing aforementioned groups hosted on the Platform or elsewhere on the Internet.</p>

    <p>You agree to comply with all applicable domestic and international laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations regarding your use of our Platform, including without limitation your participation in or involvement with any Meetupedia Group and your submission of acceptable Public Information (as defined in Section 4 ("Your Information")). You also agree to comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations regarding the transmission of technical data exported from Hungary or the country in which you reside.</p>

    <h2>2. Membership</h2>

    <p>2.1 <strong>Eligibility.</strong> Our Platform is available to all individuals who are at least 18 years of age. Our Platform is not available to any temporarily or indefinitely suspended Meetupedia users. By registering to use our Platform, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age. Additional eligibility requirements for a particular Meetupedia Group may be set by the organizer, co-organizer, or assistant organizer of the Meetupedia Group or the Meetupedia event (an "Organizer") or the host of the Meetupedia event (a "Host").</p>

    <p>We have the right, in our sole discretion, to suspend or terminate your use of our Platform and refuse any and all current or future use of all or any portion of our Platform.</p>

    <p>2.2 <strong>Password and Security.</strong> When you complete our registration process you will create a password that will enable you to access our Platform. You agree to maintain the confidentiality of your password, and are fully responsible for all liability and damages resulting from your failure to maintain that confidentiality and all activities that occur through the use of your password. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or any other breach of security. You agree that Meetupedia cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 2.2.</p>

    <h2>3. Fees and Payments</h2>

    <p>3.1 <strong>General.</strong> Access to our websites and use of selected features of our Platform is free. We may charge fees for various premium features and services that we offer, and we will notify you of those charges at the time that we offer you the premium features or services for a fee. We may, in our sole discretion, and by notifying you on our website, change this policy and begin charging for access to our website and other features and services, and we may, in our sole discretion, add, remove or change the features and services we offer or the fees (including the amount or the type of fees) we charge at any time. If we introduce a new service or charge a new fee, we will establish and notify you of the fees for that service at the launch of the service or start of charging a new fee. If we notify you of new fees or change the fees for an existing service, you agree to pay all fees and charges specified and all applicable taxes for your continued use of the applicable service. We are not responsible for any charges or expenses you incur resulting from being billed by us in accordance with these Terms of Service (e.g., overdrawn accounts, exceeding account limits, etc.). </p>

    <p>3.2 <strong>Fees Assessed by Organizers and Hosts; Payments to Organizers and Hosts.</strong> Some Organizers or Hosts may require or request fees for membership in a Group or for attendance at Meetupedia events. Individual Meetupedia Group membership fees or other event fees are at the discretion of each Organizer or Host, who decides whether such fees are required, the amount frequency, payment options, refund policies, and how such fees are spent. You may also have the option to make voluntary contributions to particular Organizers or Hosts. Fees assessed by Organizers or Hosts are remitted to the Organizer or Host and not to Meetupedia. To the extent that you use Amazon Payments, PayPal or another payment mechanism (e.g., check or cash), to pay fees assessed by an Organizer or Host, you acknowledge that Meetupedia does not control the transaction, and that you bear all risk in connection with the transaction. Refunds of any payment you make to any Organizer or Host are subject to that Organizer's or Creator's or Host's policies and applicable law. If you believe any payment to an Organizer or Host is in error, you must contact the Organizer or Host to seek resolution. You should use common sense and be careful in deciding whether to make a payment to an Organizer or Host. Organizers or Hosts have full discretion whether and how to spend money in connection with their Meetupedia Groups. We cannot ensure that an Organizer or Host is legitimate and truthful, that he or she will use payments as promised, or that you will be happy with how your payment is spent. Your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of Meetupedia Groups including payment and related services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and the applicable Organizer or Host.</p>

    <p>3.3 <strong>Meetupedia Fees; Meetupedia Subscriptions.</strong> Meetupedia Fees are paid through the subscription to Meetupedia's website hosting services for Meetupedia Groups (a "Meetupedia Subscription"). Users who allow their Meetupedia Subsription to lapse are subject to be downgraded to a free plan, and their Meetupedia Groups may be terminated or transferred to another Organizer. Meetupedia Subscriptions are billed, as elected by the member, on either a monthly, or annual recurring basis and are payable in advance of the subscription period with no refunds, except as set forth in Section 3.5 below. Meetupedia Subscriptions are non-transferable. <strong>By purchasing a Meetupedia Subscription, you authorize us to keep your subscription current by charging your credit card or PayPal account the monthly subscription fee and all applicable taxes until you discontinue your Meetupedia Subscription.</strong> To discontinue future billings of your subscription, follow the User Menu (showing your name) displayed on each website page when you are signed in. ORGANIZERS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT RECEIPT OF ANY FEE FROM ANY THIRD PARTY IS A THIRD PARTY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND SUCH THIRD PARTY, AND THAT YOU BEAR ALL RISK IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR THIRD PARTY TRANSACTIONS. If you believe that any accounting by a Third Party is in error, you must contact such other Third Party, and not Meetupedia, to seek resolution. Your correspondence or business dealings with any Third Party, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such Third Party. </p>

    <p>3.4 <strong>Promotions; Coupon Codes; Group Sponsorships.</strong> We may from time to time offer promotions where we may discount or waive certain Meetupedia fees, Meetupedia Subscriptions, or other fee-based products or services. We may offer coupon codes as a mechanism for processing a discount or credit. Coupon codes have no cash value, are not retroactive, and unless specified, are non-transferable and expire within 30 days of date of issue.</p>

    <p>3.5 <strong>Risk Free Trial.</strong> If for any reason you are dissatisfied during the first 30 days of your initial Subscription, you may request a refund of your initial  Subscription payment. You may not receive a refund more than once. We reserve the right to refuse service to a Meetupedia Group that in our determination is abusing this policy or otherwise acting in bad faith.</p>

    <p>3.6 <strong>Consent to Disclosure.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that Meetupedia may disclose Your Information (as defined in Section 4) if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to:(a) comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us or our website, (b) enforce this Agreement, (c) respond to claims that Your Information violates the rights of third parties; (d) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Meetupedia, its employees, users and the public; or (e) enable the transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of our stock or assets in the line of business to which this Agreement relates, or upon any other corporate reorganization, subject to the promises made in this Agreement. We also may disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or that we believe may expose us or you to legal liability.</p>
